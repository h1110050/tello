# Experiments with DJI Tello

We aim to use the DJI Tello as a prototype in order to build an autnonmous drone sharing service for aerial photography and videography for high traffic scenic destinations.

A python interface with Tello classes created by DJI [here](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Tello-Python) but it was developed in Python 2 which will reach EOL soon thus an alternative created by damiafuentes developed in Python 3 was used instead and can be found here: https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy
